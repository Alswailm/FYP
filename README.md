## Decoding Real Estate Dynamics: A Machine Learning Approach to Housing Price Forecasting 

#### Abstract
This research delves into the pivotal role of Machine Learning (ML) in reshaping the landscape of 
housing analysis and price forecasting. Recognizing housing as a fundamental aspect of human 
existence with profound societal and individual implications, the study leverages ML advancements 
to overcome challenges in comprehensive data analysis and accurate price predictions. The project's 
focal point is the development of a Random Forest (RF) model that utilizes housing structural details 
to predict prices, offering valuable insights for investors and real estate stakeholders. Key inquiries 
include assessing the model's accuracy, identifying influential features, and exploring challenges 
and limitations in employing an RF model for housing price estimation. The research entails a 
thorough review of prior studies, a detailed methodology encompassing data collection and model 
development, and concludes with the presentation of results and a comprehensive dataset report. 
This investigation not only contributes to advancing housing market understanding but also provides 
a framework for informed decision-making in the dynamic realm of real estate.
